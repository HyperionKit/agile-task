team and early builders.​<br>- Two pilots in active use, one on Metis and one on Hyperion, with GitHub or on chain references can show in a sheet for Metis Team.<br>A visible backlog for Metis and Hyperion templates and dashboard flows, grouped by “must have for v1” and “v2 or later.”</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Expected feat:</span><br>- Stabilize the deployment pipeline to Metis and Hyperion by adding retry logic, clear status states in the dashboard, and consistent logs in backend for each deploy, so failed deploys are easy to debug.​<br>- Run an internal security review of the main DeFi templates used on these networks, document trust assumptions, admin risks, and upgrade patterns, and publish a “known limits” section in docs.​<br>- Add simple monitoring hooks or analytics for Metis and Hyperion, for example daily counts of deploy attempts, success rates, rollback actions, and the templates most used, even if this is a rough dashboard.</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Expected feat:</span><br>- Define a Metis and Hyperion partner playbook that explains in one or two pages how a project integrates Hyperkit, what support they get, and how measure success, using language that maps to Metis ecosystem expectations.<br>- Have at least 3 ecosystem projects on Metis or Hyperion in an “active integration” stage, such as adding components, using templates, or testing with AI flows, and link each to a repo or document in tracker.</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr"><span

hashes.</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Expected feat:</span><br>- Core flows on Metis and Hyperion reach stable success rates, for example more than 80 percent of deploy attempts succeed for the supported templates, measured from logs.​<br>- Three ecosystem or partner teams are actively integrating or testing Hyperkit on these networks, with clear commitments or usage

waitlist site and Discord as the main funnel.​<br>- Tag and publish release candidate versions of SDK and CLI for Metis and Hyperion support, with a clear changelog, migration notes from earlier internal builds, and at least two realistic examples per network.​<br>- Prepare a mainnet ready path for one or two conservative flows on Metis and Hyperion, such as a simple staking or vault setup.</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Expected feat:</span><br>- Run a small monetization test with a handful of Metis and Hyperion users, for example a priced tier for extra AI generations, priority support, or “concierge deploy”, even if payment is manual or through a basic checkout link.<br>- Close at least one deeper partnership where a Metis or Hyperion project confirms they will use Hyperkit in a user facing product, campaign, or grant application and allow to reference them in Metis communications.</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr"><span
