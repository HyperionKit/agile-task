## Metadata
- Assignee: Justine
- Role: CPOO/Product Lead
- Sprint: 1
- Priority: P1
- Status: IN_PROGRESS

## Problem
HyperKit needs:
- Funding for infrastructure costs
- Marketing support for launch
- Technical guidance for Mantle integration
- Community access for user acquisition

Without partnership:
- Bootstrap funding limited
- No ecosystem support
- Slower user acquisition
- Less credibility with developers

Current state: Informal discussions. No formal agreement.

## Goal
Secure formal partnership with Mantle Network including grant funding, co-marketing agreement, and technical support. This provides:
- $25k-50k grant funding
- Co-marketing exposure
- Technical integration support
- Ambassador program access

## Success Metrics
- Grant application submitted
- Partnership meeting completed
- Co-marketing terms documented
- Technical requirements gathered
- Revenue share agreement drafted
- Timeline for deliverables agreed
