## Problem
v1 launch not announced. Without announcement:
- Community unaware of milestone
- No visibility for achievements
- Missing opportunity for press
- Ecosystem not informed

## Goal
Publish a clear "Hyperkit on Metis and Hyperion v1" announcement with links to docs, repos, and a short milestone summary that states what is shipped, what is partial, and what stays in v2, avoiding any over promise on audits or mainnet risk.
