## Problem
No structured collection of user feedback. Without tracking:
- Feature requests lost
- Bug reports unorganized
- Network-specific issues unclear
- Cannot prioritize improvements

## Goal
Collect at least 15 feature requests or bug reports for Metis and Hyperion usage through Discord, CEG forum, or GitHub issues, tagged correctly to identify which network they touch.

## Success Metrics
- 15+ feature requests collected
- All requests tagged by network (Metis/Hyperion)
- Requests categorized (bug/feature/enhancement)
- Prioritized list created
- Visible backlog published

## Technical Scope

Files to create:
```
docs/
└── feedback/
    ├── feature-requests-month3.md
    └── backlog.md
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 15+ requests collected
- [ ] All tagged with network

- [ ] Backlog visible in docs
- [ ] GitHub issues created for tracking
