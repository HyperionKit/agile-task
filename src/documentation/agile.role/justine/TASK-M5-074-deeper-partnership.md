## Problem
No deep partnership with production-facing product. Without partnership:
- No real-world validation
- Cannot reference in communications
- Missing case study opportunity
- Limited ecosystem credibility

## Goal
Close at least one deeper partnership where a Metis or Hyperion project confirms they will use HyperKit in a user-facing product, campaign, or grant application and allow reference in Metis communications.

## Success Metrics
- 1 partnership closed
- Project using HyperKit in production
- Reference permission granted
- Case study opportunity
- Visible in Metis communications
