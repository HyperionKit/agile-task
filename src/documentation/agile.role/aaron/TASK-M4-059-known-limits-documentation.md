## Problem
DeFi templates have undocumented limits and assumptions. Without documentation:

Document trust assumptions, admin risks, and upgrade patterns, and publish a "known limits" section in docs.

## Success Metrics
- Known limits section published
- Trust assumptions documented
- Admin risks explained
- Upgrade patterns documented
- Referenced by at least 1 partner team
